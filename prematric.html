            <p>the Indian government has made efforts to provide free and compulsory education to primary students through various initiatives and policies. One of the key initiatives in this regard is the Right to Education (RTE) Act, which was enacted by the Indian Parliament in 2009.

                The Right to Education Act guarantees free and compulsory education for all children between the ages of 6 and 14 years in India. It mandates that every child has the right to access quality education without any discrimination. The Act also prohibits schools from charging any kind of capitation fee or tuition fee from students up to the elementary level (class 8).
                
                Under the RTE Act, the government aims to ensure that children from all sections of society have access to primary education, regardless of their socio-economic background. The Act also emphasizes the importance of providing infrastructure facilities, trained teachers, and quality education in schools across the country.</p>
